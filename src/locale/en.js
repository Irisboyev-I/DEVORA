        content: `JSX allows you to describe user interfaces declaratively, making the component structure more intuitive and similar to traditional HTML markup. Under the hood, JSX is transformed into React.createElement calls, so it remains valid JavaScript code.

JSX supports embedding JavaScript expressions inside curly braces, enabling dynamic content rendering. It also supports nested components, conditional rendering, lists, and even styling through objects.

It's important to remember that JSX has strict syntax rules: all tags must be closed, attributes use camelCase naming (e.g., className instead of class), and you can use React fragments to group elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.`,
